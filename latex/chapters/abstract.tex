The paradigm of probabilistic programming allows for the expression of computationally arbitrary generative probabilistic models and provides general model-independent inference algorithms over them. This paper presents and overview over the theory behind one particular commonly employed inference algorithm, the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, how it can be applied to probabilistic programs, and an implementation of a probabilistic programming framework embedded into the imperative programming language Rust.
