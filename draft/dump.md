While under our current understanding of the physical world due to quantum theory all things are inherently non-deterministic, for most practical purposes, we can define deterministic rules that describe the underlying mechanics of some system of interest, like Newtonian mechanics or Maxwell's equations. However, ...

In the following, a formal elaboration of the principles underlying MCMC in general, how to apply MCMC to the task of probabilistic programming, and finally how to implement the necessary infrastructure to do so embedded inside an existing programming language will be presented.
