# Probability

Probability theory allows us to formally describe the behaviour non-deterministic process. The core idea is, rather than to make statements about individual results of the process, to define a model which describes the properties of the results of repeated runs of the process. Specifically, we describe the relative frequency (or chance of occurence) of possible results of the process.

## Discrete Probability Space

A discrete probability space is defined by the following two parts:

- $\Omega$ : An at most countable set of possible results from our process
- $p : \Omega \rightarrow [0;1]$ :
