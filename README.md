# Bachelor Thesis

## Topic Proposal: An Implementation of embedded probabilistic programming in Rust

- Embedding of probabilistic procedures in Rust via the attribute macro system of Rust (Like the embedding of [Gen](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3314221.3314642)'s modelling language in Julia)
- Implementation of conditional sampling using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) (As is implemented for example in [Church](https://web.stanford.edu/~ngoodman/papers/churchUAI08_rev2.pdf))
