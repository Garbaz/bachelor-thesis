# Bachelor Thesis

The code of this project is at [**Garbaz/probprog**](https://github.com/Garbaz/probprog).

## Topic Proposal: An Implementation of embedded probabilistic programming in Rust

Main orientation paper: [Lightweight Implementations of Probabilistic Programming Languages Via Transformational Compilation](http://proceedings.mlr.press/v15/wingate11a/wingate11a.pdf)

- Implement the infrastructure for traced probabilistic procedures
- Implement a macro that allows for writing of probabilistic functions without having to manually interact with the tracing system directly
- Implement an MCMC algorithm for general conditional inference
